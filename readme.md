# Boilerplate Meteor & React

This is my boilerplate with Meteor 1.6.1 and React 16

 * React Router 4
 * Redux actions
 * React 16.2
 * Dynamic imports examples
 * Server-side rendering
 * Amazon s3 image upload configuration
 * Meteor Toys
 * Roles based custom routes
 * Semantic UI with React
 * Touch drawer on mobile


A few routes are already setup, this is my new way to work with Meteor 1.6.1

Let me know if you think about a few improvements to start an app easily
